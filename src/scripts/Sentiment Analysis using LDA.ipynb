    "Businesses often want to know how customers think about the quality of their services to improve and make more profits. Restaurant goers may want to learn from others' experience using a variety of criteria such as food quality, service, ambience, discounts and worthiness. Yelp users may post their reviews and ratings on businesses and services or simply express their thoughts on other reviews. Bad (negative) reviews from one's perspective may influence potential customers in making decisions, e.g., a potential customer may cancel a service and persuade other do the same."

    "Topic Modelling is different from rule-based text mining approaches that use regular expressions or dictionary based keyword searching techniques. It is an unsupervised approach used for finding and observing the bunch of words (called “topics”) in large clusters of texts.\n",

    "\n",

LDA model looks for repeating term patterns in the entire DT matrix. Python provides many great libraries for text mining practices, “gensim” is one such clean and beautiful library to handle text data. It is scalable, robust and efficient. Following code shows how to convert a corpus into a document-term matrix.\n",
